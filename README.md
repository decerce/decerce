- 👋 Hi, I’m Joyce @DeCerce
- 👀 I’m interested in political tech. In my spare time, I'm building software for Democrats and progressives to run their campaigns better.
- 💼 My most recent job was running compliance + political accounting for the DNC and Harris Victory Fund.
- 🖋 I mainly write code in TypeScript/JavaScript, especially Node, React, and Express. I'm a big fan of Next.js and I know my way around SQL and NoSQL databases.
- 🌱 Everything I have learned about Perl has been against my will; still, I am slowly but surely learning to script with it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on progressive tech that makes political organizers' jobs easier.
- 📫 How to reach me: DM me on Twitter @JoyceDeCerce.
